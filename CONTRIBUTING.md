# Contributing to algorithms

All PR and issues are welcome.

## PR Rule

Work one by one on a topic(or folder).

If you have worked on a single file, please write to PR. This is to prevent others from working on duplicate topics.

Write `[WIP]` in the PR title to let you know that you are working.

```
Format - [WIP] <FolderName>
Ex) [WIP] Backtrack
```

## Commit Rule

There must be one commit per algorithm.

```
Format - Add <algorithmName> algorithm
Ex) Add circular_counter algorithm
```

Finally, when PR is merged, it becomes squash.

## File Rule

One algorithm will have two files.
One is algorithmic logic file and the other is a test file.
Please check the existing work.

## Formatting

MUST `go fmt` Please

## Etc

Thank you for your contribution.
